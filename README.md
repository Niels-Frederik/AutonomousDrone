## AutonomousDrone
Welcome to AutonomousDrone <br/>
By **Niels-Frederik** and **Yarlermanden** <br/>

This project aims to control a drone autonomously by getting its video feed, analysing it and taking action oppon it to avoid collisions

## Requirements
**[Install necessary model](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/densedepth/nyu.h5)** <br/>
This is only required for DenseDepth - mode 1. <br/>
In case the link doesn't work. Go to [DenseDepth's github](https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth) to hopefully find an updated link for the  "NYU Depth V2" trained model

**Drone network** <br/>
In case of running live with drone. You should connect to the drones wifi before starting the program.

**Install virtual environment** <br/>
Install a virtual environment from one of the three requirements.txt files depending on which mode you wish to run <br/>
* denseDepthRequirements.txt - python 3.8.5
* pydnetRequirements.txt - python 3.7.10
* fastDepthRequirements.txt - python 3.8.5

## Arguments
Different parameters

Different modes

## How to run
