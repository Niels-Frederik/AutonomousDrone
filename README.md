## AutonomousDrone
Welcome to AutonomousDrone
By **Niels-Frederik** and **Yarlermanden**

This project aims to control a drone autonomously by getting its video feed, analysing it and taking action oppon it to avoid collisions

## Requirements
**[Install necessary model](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/densedepth/nyu.h5)**
<p>
This is only required for DenseDepth - mode 1. \\
In case the link doesn't work. Go to **[DenseDepth's github](https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth)** to hopefully find an updated link for the  "NYU Depth V2" trained model
</p>

**Drone network**
<p>
In case of running live with drone. You should connect to the drones wifi before starting the program.
</p>

**Install virtual environment**
<p>
Install a virtual environment from one of the three requirements.txt files depending on which mode you wish to run
* denseDepthRequirements.txt - python 3.8.5
* pydnetRequirements.txt - python 3.7.10
* fastDepthRequirements.txt - python 3.8.5
</p>

## Arguments
Different parameters

Different modes
